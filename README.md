# Binary Search Trees

- This repository contains my solution to Springboard exercise 47.9.9.
- In this exercise, I was tasked with implementing methods on a binary search tree class.
  - Some of the methods include:
    - Searching a binary search tree.
    - Searching a binary search tree using recursion
    - Using a depth first search pre-order, post-order, in-order traversal method to gather the values from the tree.
- Check out ***binary-search-tree.js*** to see all of the instance methods that I created for the class.

## Testing

- First run:

  ```bash
  npm i
  ```

- Then run:

  ```bash
  jest binary-search-tree.test.js
  ```
